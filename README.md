# BeesInTheTrap

## Overview

**BeesInTheTrap** is a command-line-based PHP game developed as part of an interview task. The goal is to destroy a hive of bees before they sting you to death. The game is designed using modern PHP styles and design principles, incorporating Symfony components while avoiding the use of a fully prebuilt framework.

## Rules

- The game runs from the command line.
- Players start with **100 HP** and aim to destroy all bees in the hive.
- Bees are categorized into three types: **Queen Bee**, **Worker Bee**, and **Drone Bee**.
- The game alternates turns between the player and the bees.
- A player types `hit` to take their turn. After the player’s turn, the bees attack.
- The game displays a message after each turn, describing the outcome, e.g., `"Direct Hit! You took 12 hit points from a Drone bee"`.
- The game ends when either all bees are dead or the player is dead.
- Players can `auto spin` to let the game play out automatically to its conclusion.

### Bee Types

#### Queen Bee
- **Lifespan:** 100 Hit Points
- **Hit Damage:** 10 HP deducted from the Queen’s lifespan per hit
- **Sting Damage:** Player loses 10 HP per sting
- **Quantity:** 1

#### Worker Bee
- **Lifespan:** 75 Hit Points
- **Hit Damage:** 25 HP deducted from Worker’s lifespan per hit
- **Sting Damage:** Player loses 5 HP per sting
- **Quantity:** 5

#### Drone Bee
- **Lifespan:** 60 Hit Points
- **Hit Damage:** 30 HP deducted from Drone’s lifespan per hit
- **Sting Damage:** Player loses 1 HP per sting
- **Quantity:** 25

### Game Mechanics

- Each bee type has different hit and sting damage.
- Bees and players have a chance to miss their attacks.
- The bee and player targets are chosen randomly but should reflect statistical chances based on bee types.
- Destroying the Queen Bee results in all remaining bees dying.

2. **Design:** Outlining the game structure and flow.
3. **Implementation:** Writing the game logic in PHP, ensuring modern design principles.
4. **Testing:** Writing unit tests to ensure all components work as expected.
5. **Refinement:** Enhancing the game based on feedback and testing results.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The main language used to develop the game.
- **Symfony Components**: Utilized `symfony/console` for command-line interactions.
- **Composer**: Used for managing PHP dependencies.

## Testing

Unit tests are included to ensure the game logic and components function correctly. To run the tests, execute the following command:
